Solving puzzles in the style of the game show Countdown.

This repository contains the source code for a [series of articles](https://cgjennings.ca/articles/?tag=Countdown)
I'm writing that examine the game show Countdown from a computational
perspective.
It currently contains code to solve puzzles similar to those used in the
*numbers round* of that show.
Expect more code to follow as the series progresses.

The code is in plain, modern JavaScript, but type information suitable
for TypeScript is included in the doc comments.
